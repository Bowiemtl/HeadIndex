# HeadIndex
Head Index is an easy to user server-side head database mod for the Fabric Loader. Head Index provides easy access to over 36,000 heads provided by minecraft-heads.com. Unlike a plugin, Head Index can also be used in singleplayer without the need for a server. New heads are added all the time and will be automatically added whenever you restart the server without needing to update. Heads all have a UUID and texture value set to eliminate the lagspikes experienced with traditional custom playerheads.
